      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Laercio Souza, a Software Developer :) I like to build web aplications, and for that I learned React to create really nice front-end pages and django when I need something fast, secure and badass. Of course these are just frameworks,  working with newest frameworks like these is nice, but nothing as good as fundamentals. What you are seeing now is me trying to show my work. If you like this or have some feedback, please contact-me. Thank you ðŸ’œ",

It keeps symptoms, problems, and solutions that later(future projects) can be used to predict the behavior of a given home appliance. I built the backend using containerized(Docker) Django and Django Rest Framework divided into 3 modules(appliances, profiles, and services) using test-driven development with more than 230 tests and deployed on Heroku. The front-end is ReactJs deployed on Vercel, links are on the Github page.",
